A form page for each type of schedule; regular, advisory, activity, halfday

Each form has entries for all of the periods of the day; 8-820, 820 - 1st per, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, activity, , EoD PD, lunch, passing periods, end of 7th to 420.

Form also needs school year, e.g., 2023-2024

A selector for 6th, 7th and 8th grade. Radio buttons?

At the bottom, a next button. On the last page a submit.

The app converts the time for each period to minutes (of the day where midnight is 0 and 8:20 = 500)

All data is validated on blur with visual indication of a problem (shaking turning red) (must include :? 24hr format?)

Passing period fills itself based on the end time of the period. (do on blur)

On SUBMIT the app writes a file, 'constant.js' with the required values. Managed as a template literal. File named (or located ina directory) based on grade level.

'schedule.js' is changed to read these constants, instead of being hard coded for times. e.g., ${RegFirstPassingEnd} or ${AdvFifthStart} where the first three letters are the type of schedule, reg, adv, act, or hlf, followed by the period First, Second, etc, or FirstPass, ThirdPass, and then either Start or End

Typescript... just to increase the difficulty

Possibly compile... what issues are there for this being run locally given that it has to access the hard drive? Electron? (This may not be possible).
The main issue here is that this would greatly slow down production, since even simple things would have to be relearned. If straight JS can save to the hard drive, an Electron app will not be needed.
